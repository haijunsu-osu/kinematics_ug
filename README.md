# kinematics_ug
This repository includes kits for teaching kinematics concepts for undergraduate students. These kits are developed for ME 3751 Kinematics and Mechanism Design at Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, The Ohio State University. Contact Prof. Haijun Su (su.298@osu.edu) if you have any question regarding to these kits.
